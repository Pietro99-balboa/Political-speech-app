PoliAnalyzer 

Imagine an intelligent platform that allows users to dissect political speeches, providing real-time insights into the language, sentiment, and rhetorical strategies used by politicians. This app processes both written and spoken speeches, breaking them down into key themes and patterns. Users can explore sentiment trends, identifying whether a speech leans toward optimism, fear, or persuasion, while also detecting rhetorical techniques such as emotional appeals or strategic repetition.

The app enables side-by-side analysis of speeches from different politicians on similar topics, revealing shifts in messaging and political positioning over time.

The experience is made even more engaging through interactive visualizations, such as word clouds. Whether for journalists aiming to report objectively, researchers conducting political communication studies, or engaged citizens wanting to critically assess political discourse, this tool serves as a valuable resource for navigating the complexities of modern political speech.
