Imagine an intelligent platform that allows users to dissect political speeches, providing real-time insights into the language, sentiment, and rhetorical strategies used by politicians. This app processes both written and spoken speeches, breaking them down into key themes and patterns. Users can explore sentiment trends, identifying whether a speech leans toward optimism, fear, or persuasion, while also detecting rhetorical techniques such as emotional appeals or strategic repetition.

The app enables side-by-side analysis of speeches from different politicians on similar topics, revealing shifts in messaging and political positioning over time.

The experience is made even more engaging through interactive visualizations, such as word clouds. Whether for journalists aiming to report objectively, researchers conducting political communication studies, or engaged citizens wanting to critically assess political discourse, this tool serves as a valuable resource for navigating the complexities of modern political speech.

The users can interact with different features like: 
1) a Box where the app is elaborating the speech the user insert and give a result related to the political affiliation of the speaker
2) Depending on the political faction the app is going to use a different colour, for exampe: If the speaker is belonging to a liberal party the colour will be light blue, if the speak will belong to the communist party the colour will be red and so on 
3) Another Box is going to inform the user of the rethorical figures presented in the speech 
4) If the app it's going to detect some narrative in the spech the box "Narratives" is going to list for the users
5) The last box you can find on the app is going to detect eventual ideology inside the speech the user insert
